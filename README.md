# Day 2 Challenge

## What do I Learn

Learn about Git remotes. Github repositories are capable of having different remotes(URL pointers), usually one pointing to the original repository and one pointing to the forked repository. Changes on the original repository are pulled(git pull) to make the local code base up to date. When the local codebase is up to date, additional code can be added to it, then a push is made to the forked repository to make it up to date or ready for pull requests. That said a typical Git/Github project involves the Original repository(origin), the forked repository(free to call it what you want), and a local copy.

## Tasks

- Add Multiple remotes to your project

- One remote should be called origin(The Original Repository), that is https://github.com/fbdevcowerri/git-14days-challenge

- The Other remote should be called <your-github-name>, i.e prondubuisi, in my case that is https://github.com/prondubuisi/git-14days-challenge

- Pull from  remote origin to keep local repo up to date

- Push to  forked <your-github-name> repo to keep forked repo up to date

- Add Screenshots to show command execution

Extra -  feel free to send in a Pull request if you see a typo, spelling error anywhere in this codebase 

## Day 2 Challenge, how to submit
- Create a file called <yourname-day2.md> in the [day2challenge](day2challenge) folder, for screenshots

- To see all your current remotes

- Run `git remote -v` on terminal or CMD

- Add Screenshot to show output

- Add a new remote with format `git remote add <github-name> <your-forked-repo-url>` 

- In my case I will Run `git remote add prondubuisi https://github.com/prondubuisi/git-14days-challenge`

- Run `git remote -v` on terminal or CMD to see new remotes

- Add screenshot to show output

- To pull changes from Original repository

- run `git pull origin master`

- To push changes to forked repository

- run `git push <git-username> master`

- In my case I will run `git push prondubuisi master`

- add Screenshot to show command output

- Add all screenshots to file created and make a pull request

- Make a Post in the [Facebook group](http://bit.ly/fbowerri) telling us about your Progress and what you have learnt
