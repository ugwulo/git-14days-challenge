# Day 3 Challenge

## What do I Learn
We will master creating github issues, making issues reference commits , writing good commit messages and
writing commits that span multiple lines. We will also learn about git log and 
git status commands.

Writing good and clear commit messages is one of the recommended git best practices.

## Tasks
- Create Github issue for your commit

- Make commits spanning multiple lines

- Write good commit messages

- Push commit to github as PR

## Day 3 Challenge, how to submit
- Create an Issue on this repository. Issue should read Add `<my-name>` to contributors list
  
- In my case it will read Add Ndubuisi Onyemenam to Contributors list

- Go to Project folder in your computer and Run the `git log` command on your CMD or Terminal

- You will see a blinking colon :, type wq then enter to exit

- Run `git status` command on your CMD or Terminal

- Add screenshot to show both output

- Run git pull origin master to pull in lastest changes from repo

- Add your name to [contributors.md](day3challenge/contributors.md)  file in day3challenge folder

- run `git add .` to add all changes

- run `git commit` command without the -m flag

- Notice that you have a text editor open

- Screenshot the open Editor

- Write Commit message header i.e Add my name to contributors list

- add screenshot of commands made

- Write Fixes Issue #`<the issue number you created>` above in the line following it
 - All in all your commit message will look like
  ```
  Add my name to contributors list
  
  add screenshot of commands made
  fix issue #27
  
  ```
- Pro Tip: All commit messages should  be in the present tense

- Also good commit message are in the format ; this commit will "Your commit message in present tense", all our commit messges fit well with this rule i.e this commit will;  fix issue #27 etc
  
- Since commit messages should not be more than 50 characters long(too), we write extra commit message lines  after the initial message line, see [screenshot](day3challenge/ndubuisi-day3.md#add-editor-screenshot) for example

- Save file by pressing Controlkey + o

- Then press enter

- Press Control + x to exit the editor

- Create a file called <yourname-day3.md> in the [day3challenge](day3challenge) folder

- Add a Screenshot image for git status and git log command

- Add a Screenshot image for the git commit editor 

- Make a pull request to submit contributors.md file and your day 3 screenshot file

- Make a Post in the [Facebook group](http://bit.ly/fbowerri) telling us about your Progress and what you have learnt

- Extra -  feel free to send in a Pull request if you see a typo, spelling error anywhere in this codebase
