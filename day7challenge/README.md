# Day 7 Challenge

## What do I learn?

Today we will be learning about project boards on GitHub! I bet you might have seen it but don't know what it's used for or even are totally not aware of what the projects feature is about.

#### Brief Overview
GitHub project boards helps you keep track of stuffs you're actively working on within your repository. You can say it's a project managemnet tool, or even a collaboration tool for teams. You create a project board with columns for your TODO or backlogs or even bugs, In progress activies and lastly a column for your finished tasks. You can sort of see it as a SCRUM board (but trust me the use case is not limited).

## Tasks

- Create a GitHub repository for any project you can think up (Anything! as long you're comfortable building it);
- On a sheet of paper create a TODO list (or backlog) of features you want to have in you app
- Create a project board with a `TODO` column, `In progress`, `Done`
- Create a card for all the items you already wrote on the sheet of paper in the TODO column
- Work on the features synchronously and move the card respectively for each in progress task to the `In progress` column
- When you're done with the `In progress` task move the card to the `Done` column
- Repeat this steps until you've completely built out the entire project/app feature on you TODO column

## How to submit your entry

- Take a screen shot of your project board for when you created a TODO item on the `TODO` column
- Take a screen shot of your project board for when you moved a card from `TODO` to `In progress`
- Take a screen shot of your project board for when you moved an card from `In progress` to `Done`
- Create a markdown file with your name and the day's challenge, e.g `prosper-day7.md` in your fork of this repo (Remember to pull to ensure your fork is upto date, we already learnt how to do this)
- Add you screenshots to the markdown
- Finally create a PR!

We look forward to recieving your submissions
