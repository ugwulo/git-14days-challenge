## What do I learn?

Today we will be learning about Git Aliases! :). This is an amazing feature that helps us use less keystroke

#### Brief Overview

 The term alias is synonymous with a shortcut. Alias creation is a common pattern found in other popular utilities like `bash` shell. Aliases are used to create shorter commands that map to longer commands. Aliases enable more efficient workflows by requiring fewer keystrokes to execute a command (copied! I'm pretty lazy this morning :) ). To learn more;

 ## Tasks

 - Complete studying about Alias with the link I shared
 - Create at least 2 alias for any git command you feel is too long

 ## How to submit your entry

 - Take a screenshot of the alias you created. hint run `git config --list`
 - Take a screenshot of your alias in action!
 - Fork this repo (or update your forked repo if you already forked)
 - create a new branch for your submission
 - Add the screenshots to your submission file e.g `prosper-day8.md`
 - Create a PR!

 Looking forward to reviewing your PR :)
